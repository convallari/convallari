# About me

My ultimate life goal is to be a designer of the real world around me.  
In this endeavor, itâ€™s crucial to identify problems and requirements while focusing on my existing knowledge, resources, and capabilities to creatively address those challenges.  
Surround yourself with people you like, acquire valuable knowledge and techniques, and engage in meaningful activities.  
Keep learning and practicing.
