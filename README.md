# About me

My ultimate life goal is to be a designer. This entails identifying problems and requirements, while concentrating on my existing knowledge, resources, and capabilities to effectively address those challenges.
I'm still exploring how I can contribute to the world, and I'm always open to new ideas and experiences.
